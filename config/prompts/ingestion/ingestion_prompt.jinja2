You are an expert document processor. Your task is to properly chunk and process the following document for a RAG system.

Document content:
{{ document_content }}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the content structure to identify natural section breaks
2. Preserve the semantic meaning of each chunk
3. Maintain important context and relationships between sections
4. Extract key metadata such as:
   - Document type
   - Main topics
   - Key entities mentioned
   - Creation date (if available)

The goal is to create chunks that:
- Are self-contained and coherent
- Have appropriate context for retrieval
- Maintain important relationships and hierarchies
- Are optimally sized for embedding (neither too large nor too small)

Process the content and provide:
1. Chunked content with logical breaks
2. Extracted metadata for each chunk
3. Any special handling recommendations for this document type
