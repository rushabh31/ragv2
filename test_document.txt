Test Document for Groq Vision Processing

This is a test document to verify that the Groq vision model can properly extract text content from documents.

Key Points:
1. Document parsing with Groq vision models
2. Text extraction capabilities
3. Integration with the RAG ingestion pipeline
4. Sentence transformer embeddings with all-MiniLM-L12-v2

Technical Details:
- Model: llama-3.2-11b-vision-preview
- Embedding Model: all-MiniLM-L12-v2 (384 dimensions)
- Vector Store: FAISS with HNSW indexing

This document should be successfully processed through the ingestion pipeline using:
1. Groq vision parser for text extraction
2. Fixed-size chunking for content segmentation
3. Sentence transformer embeddings for vector representation
4. FAISS vector store for similarity search

End of test document.
